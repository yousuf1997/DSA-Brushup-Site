 <p> What is String?</p>
 <div class="note-comment-block">
    A String is basically array of characters. Usually contains text. String is immutable, which means programmer assigns value
    to a String, and reassign another value to the same variable, the previous variable will remain in the string pool.

<p>How to initialzie a String?</p>
<div class="note-comment-block">
    <ul>
      <li>There are two ways to initialize the string.
         <ol>
             <li>
                  Initialize a String using string literals.
                  <br>
                  <code class="code-block">
                      String s = "I am a String Literal";

             </li>
             <li>
                  Initialize a String using String object.

<p>How to check if two strings are equal?</p>
<div class="note-comment-block">

   This is bit tricky becuase we may assume that we may '==' operator to compare two strings. This double equal operator compares the memory locations of a string by default. 
   If you have two strings with exactly the same content, and one of the string was intialized using the literals, and other one was using the object.
   Depsite the content is the same but each of the content resides in different memory locations thus it returns false. The correct way to compare is follows

</div>
<br>
<code class="code-block">

      string1.equals(string2);
</code>
<br>
<div class="note-comment-block">
  If you would like to ignore the case.
</div>
<br>
<code class="code-block">

      string1.equalsIgnoreCase(string2);

<p>How to get a particular character of a String?</p>
<br>
<div class="note-comment-block">
    Since the String is array of characters, we can access the character by the index. Make sure the index you pass
    to the chatAt() does not exceed the size of the string n - 1. 
</div>
<br>
<code class="code-block">
      string1.charAt(2);
</code>
<br>
<p>How to check if particular sequence of a character exists in the String?</p>
<code class="code-block">
      string1.contains("water");
</code>
<br>
<p>How to get length of a String?</p>
<code class="code-block">
      string1.length();
</code>
<br>
<p>How to iterate the characters of a String?</p>
<code class="code-block">
      for(int i = 0; i &lt; string1.length(); i++){
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println(string1.charAt(i));
        <br>
      }
